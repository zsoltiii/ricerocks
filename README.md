# RiceRocks
An implementation of the classic Asteroids game as part of the 'An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python' Rice University course (https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1). 

# Installation
You don't need to install anything, as a matter of fact, this game won't even run as a Python program. 

It has been developed in Rice University's online, browser-based Python interpreter using a subset of Python 2 and graphical libraries, such as SimpleGui. 

# Play
